<h1>Binary Tree Creator</h1>
<h2>Infos</h2>
<p>Binary Tree Cerator has the goal to help with the visualization of Binary Trees. By creating a new tree there is also a possibility to activate an AVL-property to hold the balance of the tree. Later on there will be also an IOS and Android App to create Binary Trees on the go. Also an Mac-App is in planning. 
Binary Trees are just the start of that Project. My personal goal is to create a tool which can handle every mathematical tree which are currently state of the art. For example the visualization of probability trees. I'm open for comments which give me tips for improving the code which I currently have written.

<h2>Diagramms und Blueprints</h2>
<p>The windows application will look something like this:</p>
